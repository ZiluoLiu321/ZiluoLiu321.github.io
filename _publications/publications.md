## Research Publications

I am currently in the early stages of my PhD program in Environmental Engineering at Tsinghua University. My research focuses on air quality modeling and computational fluid dynamics applications in environmental systems. 

**Research Areas:**
- Air quality modeling and simulation
- Computational fluid dynamics in environmental applications
- Atmospheric pollutant transport and dispersion
- Urban air quality assessment and prediction
