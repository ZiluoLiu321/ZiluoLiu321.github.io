## Conference Presentations & Talks

*Conference presentations and talks will be added upon participation in academic conferences.*

As a PhD student beginning my research journey, I look forward to presenting my work at academic conferences and sharing findings with the scientific community.

**Planned Presentation Topics:**
- Air quality modeling methodologies
- CFD applications in environmental engineering
- Urban atmospheric pollutant dispersion studies
- Environmental data analysis and visualization techniques

Conference presentations and invited talks will be documented here as my research progresses.
